            <p>
                I am currently a Third year CS undergraduate student at <b>Atma Ram Sanatan Dharma College, Dhaula Kuan.</b> I love designing and creating new things!
                I was born in Pune, Maharashtra and travelled to several states during my early childhood, but I can safely say that I was brought up in New Delhi.
                I listen to all types of music and love to make some amateur tunes of my own, when I'm free.

            <p>
                I wish to pursue some form of higher education after completing my Bachelor's degree. I haven't decided
                yet about the particular subject, but I believe I will end up dabbling into some Computer Science related
                fields.
